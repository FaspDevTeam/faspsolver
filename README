The FASP package is designed for developing and testing new efficient solvers 
and preconditioners for discrete partial differential equations (PDEs) or 
systems of PDEs. The main components of the package are standard Krylov methods, 
algebraic multigrid methods, and incomplete factorization methods. Based on 
these standard techniques, we build efficient solvers, based on the framework 
of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning, for several complicated applications. 
Current examples include the fluid dynamics, underground water simulation, 
the black oil model in reservoir simulation, and so on. 

To compile, you need a C99 compiler and a F90 compiler. By default, we use GNU
gcc/gfortan, respectively; see INSTALL for more details.

Configuring and building the FASP library and test suite requires CMake 2.6 or
higher, which can be found at http://www.cmake.org/.

There is a top level Makefile which calls cmake for configuration and building 
of the FASP shared library and the test programs suite.

The command to configure is:

    $ make config 

or

    $ make config CC=clang   // to choose a C compiler
    $ make config openmp=yes // to enable OpenMP
    $ make config debug=yes  // to enable DEBUG mode

After successfully configing the environment, just type:

    $ make                   // to compile the shared library and examples
    
To install the FASP library and executables, type:

    $ make install

Note: The default prefix is the FASP source directory.
