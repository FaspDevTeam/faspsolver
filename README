The FASP package is designed for developing and testing new efficient solvers 
and preconditioners for discrete partial differential equations (PDEs) or 
systems of PDEs. The main components of the package are standard Krylov methods, 
algebraic multigrid methods, and incomplete factorization methods. Based on 
these standard techniques, we build efficient solvers, based on the framework 
of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning, for several complicated applications. 
Current examples include the fluid dynamics, underground water simulation, 
the black oil model in reservoir simulation, and so on. 

To compile, you need a C99 compiler and a F77 compiler. By default, we use 
gfortan and gcc, respectively; see INSTALL for more details. Configuring and 
building the FASP library and test suite requires CMake 2.6 or higher, which 
can be found at http://www.cmake.org/ .

There is a top level Makefile which calls cmake for configuration and building 
of the FASP shared library and the test programs suite. The command to configure
is:

    $ make config 

or

    $ make config openmp=yes // in order to enable OpenMP

or

    $ make config debug=yes // in order to enable DEBUG mode

After configuring, to compile the shared library, just type 

    $ make 

To install FASP library and executables for testing and tutorial:

    $ make install

Note: The default prefix is the FASP source directory.
