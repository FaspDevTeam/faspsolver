/** \mainpage Introduction
 *
 * Over the last few decades, researchers have expended significant effort on
 * developing efficient iterative methods for solving discretized partial differential
 * equations (PDEs). Though these efforts have yielded many mathematically optimal
 * solvers such as the multigrid method, the unfortunate reality is that multigrid
 * methods have not been much used in practical applications. This marked gap between
 * theory and practice is mainly due to the fragility of traditional multigrid (MG)
 * methodology and the complexity of its implementation. We aim to develop techniques
 * and the corresponding software that will narrow this gap, specifically by developing
 * mathematically optimal solvers that are robust and easy to use in practice.
 *
 * We believe that there is no one-size-for-all solution method for discrete linear
 * systemsfrom different applications. And, efficient iterative solvers can be
 * constructed by taking the properties of PDEs and discretizations into account. In
 * this project, we plan to construct a pool of discrete problems arising from partial
 * differential equations (PDEs) or PDE systems and efficient linear solvers for these
 * problems. We mainly utilize the methodology of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning (ASP)
 * to construct efficient linear solvers. Due to this reason, this software package
 * is called Fast Auxiliary Space Preconditioning or FASP for short.
 * 
 * The levels of abstraction are designed as follows:
 *
 * - Level 0 (Aux*.c): Auxiliary functions (timing, memory, threading, ...)
 *
 * - Level 1 (Bla*.c): Basic linear algebra subroutines (SpMV, RAP, ILU, SWZ, ...)
 *
 * - Level 2 (Itr*.c): Iterative methods and smoothers (Jacobi, GS, SOR, Poly, ...)
 *
 * - Level 3 (Kry*.c): Krylov iterative methods (CG, BiCGstab, MinRes, GMRES, ...)
 *
 * - Level 4 (Pre*.c): Preconditioners (GMG, AMG, FAMG, ...)
 *
 * - Level 5 (Sol*.c): User interface for FASP solvers (Solvers, wrappers, ...)
 *
 * - Level x (Xtr*.c): Interface to external packages (Mumps, Umfpack, ...)
 *
 * FASP contains the kernel part and several applications (ranging from fluid dynamics  
 * to reservoir simulation). The kernel part is open-source and licensed under GNU 
 * Lesser General Public License or LGPL version 3.0 or later. Some of the applications 
 * contain contributions from and owned partially by other parties.
 *
 * > For the moment, FASP is under alpha testing. If you wish to obtain a current version
 * > of FASP or you have any questions, feel free to contact us at faspdev@gmail.com.

/**
 * \page download How to obtain FASP
 *
 * The most updated version of FASP can be downloaded from
 *
 * > http://www.multigrid.org/fasp/download/faspsolver.zip
 *
 * We use HG (Mecurial) as our main version control tool. HG is easy to use and it is 
 * available at all OS platforms. For people who is interested in the developer version, 
 * you can obtain the FASP package with hg: 
 * 
 * > $ hg clone https://faspusers@bitbucket.org/fasp/faspsolver 
 * 
 * will give you the developer version of the FASP package.

/**
 * \page build Building and Installation
 *
 * This is a simple instruction on building and testing. For more details, please refer to 
 * the README files and the short
 * <a href="http://fasp.sourceforge.net/download/userguide.pdf">User's Guide</a> in 
 * "faspsolver/doc/".
 *
 * To compile, you need a Fortran and a C compiler.  First, you can type in the "faspsolver/"
 * root directory:
 *
 * > $ make config
 * 
 * which will config the environment automatically. And, then, you can need to type:
 *
 * > $ make install
 *
 * which will make the FASP shared static library and install to PREFIX/. By default, FASP 
 * libraries and executables will be installed in the FASP home directory "faspsolver/".
 *
 * There is a simple GUI tool for building and installing FASP included in the package. You 
 * need Tcl/Tk support in your computer. You may call this GUI by run in the root directory:
 *
 * > $ wish fasp_install.tcl
 *
 * If you need to see the detailed usage of "make" or need any help, please type:
 *
 * > $ make help
 *
 * After installation, tutorial examples can be found in "tutorial/".
